# xipepe-odin-recipe-project
As part of the training that I am taking with the Odin Project, I was assigned a very difficult HTML website project. 
This repository is the result of hard work and sleepless nights.

Even though I have been a web developer for a while, this  task was my first reminder of HTML basic concepts.

To conclude the exercise, had to relearn some of the HTML elements and CSS rules I did not use for a long time, and the result speaks for itself.

🤓 I hope you all enjoy 😎.

The project is huge. Currently has more that 5K collaborators, yes you "heard" it right. 5 fucking thousand collaborators.
