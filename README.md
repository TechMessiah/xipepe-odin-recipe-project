# xipepe-odin-recipe-project
As part of the training that I am taking with the Odin Project, I was assigned a very difficult HTML website project. This preository is the result of hard work and sleepless nights.


Even though I have been a web developer for a while, this was my first contact with HTML.

To conclude the exercise, I had to learn HTML and CSS and the result speaks by itself. 

I hope you all enjoy.
